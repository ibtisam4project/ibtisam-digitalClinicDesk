Digital Clinic Desk

Digital Clinic Desk is a healthcare patient management application designed to act as an online clinic reception system. The application simplifies the process of patient registration, appointment booking, and appointment management by replacing traditional manual methods with a digital solution.

The system allows patients to easily register and book appointments with doctors using a mobile-friendly interface, while administrators can efficiently manage schedules, confirm or cancel appointments, and send SMS notifications for appointment updates. This improves communication, reduces waiting time, and enhances overall healthcare service efficiency.

Built using modern development tools and frameworks, the application focuses on usability, reliability, and scalability for real-world healthcare environments, especially clinics and small hospitals.
